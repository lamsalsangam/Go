# Go Proverbs(Rob Pike, one of Go's creators)

- Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.

- Concurrency is not parallelism.

- Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.

- The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.

- Make the zero value useful.

- interface{} says nothing.

- Gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.

- A little copying is better than a little dependency.

- Syscall must always be guarded with build tags.

- Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.

- Cgo is not Go.

- With the unsafe package there are no guarantees.

- Clear is better than clever.

- Reflection is never clear.

- Errors are values.

- Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully.

- Design the architecture, name the components, document the details.

- Documentation is for users.

- Don't panic.
